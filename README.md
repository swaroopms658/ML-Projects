# I-Projects

This directory contains two machine learning projects:

1. **Diabetes Diagnosis Prediction**: A web application that predicts the likelihood of diabetes in a patient based on input features.
2. **Customer Category Prediction**: A web application that classifies customers into different categories based on their data.

Each project includes a demo recording of the working model.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Python, Flask
- **Machine Learning**: scikit-learn

## Installation and Setup

To run these projects locally:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/swaroopms658/ML-Projects.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

   ```bash
   cd ML-Projects/I-Projects
   ```

3. **Set up a virtual environment**:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

4. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. **Run the application**:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

   The application should now be running locally.
